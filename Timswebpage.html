  <h2> About Me </h2>
  <p> Hello, my name is Timothy Vadasz and I am currently a Junior at Saginaw Valley State University. I was born and still live in Brownstown MI.</p>
  <h2> Education </h2>
  <p> I came to SVSU after graduating from Woodhaven Highschool back in 2019. At Woodhaven I was involved in varsity sports such as Tennis and Baseball, alongside 
    taking 4 different AP classes, 3 being my senior year, and one of them being AP computer science. I graduated from highschool with a 3.6 GPA and continued that into
    college. My freshman year second semester I finished with a 4.0 despite being sent home in the middle of the semester due to Covid-19. Currently I have a 3.4 GPA, 
    that I intend to continue to improve upon until my projected graduation date of May 2023.</p>
  <h2> Employment </h2>
  <p> During the school year, I am employed as a library technician on my college campus. I help with computer, printer, and internet issues, as well as helping to 
    check out materials to faculty and students. During the summertime, I have changed jobs from year to year. Most recently being a summer teller at Flagstar bank where
    along with doing the daily tasks associated with the job, made sure to learn the software that they use to the fullest and even attempt to make improvements upon it.
