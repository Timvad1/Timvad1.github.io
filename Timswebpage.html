  <h2> About Me </h2>
  <p2> Hello, my name is Timothy Vadasz and I am currently a Junior at Saginaw Valley State University. I was born and still live in Brownstown MI.</p2>
  <h3> Education </h3>
  <p3> I came to SVSU after graduating from Woodhaven Highschool back in 2019. At Woodhaven I was involved in varsity sports such as Tennis and Baseball, alongside 
    taking 4 different AP classes, 3 being my senior year, and one of them being AP computer science. I graduated from highschool with a 3.6 GPA and continued that into
    college. My freshman year second semester I finished with a 4.0 despite being sent home in the middle of the semester due to Covid-19. Currently I have a 3.4 GPA, 
    that I intend to continue to improve upon until my projected graduation date of May 2023.</p3>
